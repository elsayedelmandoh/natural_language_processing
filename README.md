# Natural Language Processing Repository

Welcome to the 'Natural Language Processing' repository! This repository is your comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. Dive into various topics, from basic introductions to advanced techniques, to gain a deeper understanding of processing and analyzing text data.

## Topics Covered

1. Intro to NLP: Get started with an introduction to Natural Language Processing, understanding its importance and applications.
2. Tokenizers and Stop Words: Learn about tokenization, splitting text into words or phrases, and stop words removal, eliminating common words with little semantic meaning.
3. Core Fundamentals: Explore core fundamentals of NLP, including text normalization, handling punctuation, and case conversion.
4. Stemming and Lemmatization: Understand the process of reducing words to their base or root form for normalization and analysis.
5. WordNet: Discover WordNet, a lexical database for English, and its applications in NLP tasks such as synonym and antonym identification.
6. Named Entity Recognition: Learn how to identify and classify named entities in text, such as persons, organizations, and locations.
7. Part of Speech Tagging: Explore the process of assigning parts of speech to words in a sentence, enabling deeper linguistic analysis.
8. Chunking: Dive into chunking, a process of grouping words into meaningful phrases based on their syntactic structure.
9. Chinking: Understand chinking, the process of removing parts of a chunk based on specific patterns or criteria.
10. Words Embedding: Explore word embeddings, dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic meaning.
11. Vectorization: Learn about vectorization techniques for converting text data into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
12. Count Vectorizer: Understand Count Vectorization, a technique for converting text documents into a matrix of token counts.
13. Yelp Reviews Classifier: Dive into a project where you'll build a classifier to predict the sentiment of Yelp reviews using NLP techniques.
14. TF-IDF Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency: Explore TF-IDF, a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
15. Word2Vec: Learn about Word2Vec, a popular word embedding technique based on neural networks, capturing semantic meaning and relationships between words.

Whether you're new to NLP or seeking to deepen your understanding of advanced techniques, this repository provides valuable content, examples, and resources to support your learning journey.
